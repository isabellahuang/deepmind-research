The Colab notebook `cifar10_medium_cnn_experiments.ipynb` illustrates the CIFAR-10
experiments in the paper:

[Deep Ensembles: A Loss Landscape Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02757)
by Stanislav Fort, Huiyi Hu and Balaji Lakshminarayanan

These experiments investigate the effects of ensembling and variational Bayesian
methods, please see the paper for more details.
