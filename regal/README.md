This dataset contains dataflow computational graphs generated procedurally,
intended for training and evaluating algorithms that optimize execution (e.g.
placement and scheduling), in

(Paliwal, Gimeno, Nair, Li, Lubin, Kohli, Vinyals)

## Folder structure

There are 10000 training graphs, 1000 validation graphs and 1000 test graphs.
The file names follow the format of "graph_" plus a hash of the graph topology
plus ".pbtxt".

## Filtering

For each set (train, valid, test) there are not two graphs with the same
topology. We used the Biased Random Key Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA) to filter out
graphs that did not have "room for improvement"

"Room for improvement" was defined as the union of two conditions:

*   if BRKGA with a low fitness evaluation limit (number of calls to fitness
    function) did not fit the hardware constraints and BRKGA with a high number
    did.
*   if BRKGA with a high fitness evaluation limit was 20% faster in running time
    that BRKGA with a low number.

## Example Graph

```protobuf
node {
  name: "_SOURCE"
}
node {
  name: "node_0"
  id: 1
  control_input: 0
}
node {
  name: "node_1"
  id: 2
  output_info {
    size: 70
    alias_input_port: -1
  }
  control_input: 0
  compute_cost: 58
}
node {
  name: "node_2"
  id: 3
  output_info {
    size: 52
    alias_input_port: -1
  }
  control_input: 0
  compute_cost: 47
}
node {
  name: "node_3"
  id: 4
  input_info {
    preceding_node: 2
  }
  output_info {
    size: 55
    alias_input_port: -1
  }
  control_input: 0
  compute_cost: 58
}
```
