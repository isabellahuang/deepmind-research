# VISR - Fast Task Inference with Variational Intrinsic Successor Features

This directory contains a [Tensorflow-v1](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions#tensorflow_1x) / [Sonnet](https://sonnet.dev) implementation of
the VISR algorithm in a notebook explaining how the approach can be used for task inference in a simple GridWorld.
To launch the notebook in Google colab, [click here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/deepmind/deepmind_research/blob/master/visr/VISR_ICLR2020.ipynb).


VISR is a novel algorithm which learns controllable features that can be leveraged to provide enhanced generalization and fast task inference through the successor feature framework.
