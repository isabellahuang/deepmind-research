  """Dynamically batches trees with `jraph.GraphsTuples` to `graph_batch_size`.

  Elements of the `graphs_tuple_iterator` will be incrementally added to a batch
  until the limits defined by `n_node`, `n_edge` and `n_graph` are reached. This
  means each element yielded by this generator

  For situations where you have variable sized data, it"s useful to be able to
  have variable sized batches. This is especially the case if you have a loss
  defined on the variable shaped element (for example, nodes in a graph).

  Args:
    graphs_tuple_iterator: An iterator of `jraph.GraphsTuples`.
    n_node: The maximum number of nodes in a batch.
    n_edge: The maximum number of edges in a batch.
    n_graph: The maximum number of graphs in a batch.

  Yields:
    A `jraph.GraphsTuple` batch of graphs.

  Raises:
    ValueError: if the number of graphs is < 2.
    RuntimeError: if the `graphs_tuple_iterator` contains elements which are not
      `jraph.GraphsTuple`s.
    RuntimeError: if a graph is found which is larger than the batch size.
